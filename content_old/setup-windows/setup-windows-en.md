# Compiling Scribus on Windows

## Installing Windows in VirtualBox

This is for people working on Linux but wanting to be able to compile Scribus under Windows (or if you're under any OS and want to install the development environment without messing with your current install).

- create a virtual machine with 30 GB disk space
- install Firefox (+adblock plus and flashblock)
- In the VirtualBox menu, "Devices > Install Guest Additions..." (to get better integration with you host system)
- Download, install, and activate Visual Studio Express for Windows Desktop
- download and install "git extensions"
- install putty (use putty-installer)

download the QtSdk from qt-project.org
