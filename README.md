# Developing Scribus

(or contributing to Scribus)

This manual was started as a highly structured set of documents that has never reached a useful state.

The project is rebooted as a single file -- placed in the `content/` directory -- that will be split in smaller files as needed.

The old files have been moved to `content_old/` and will be deleted as soon all the content has been copied over in the new file(s).

You can contribute by forking, branching and request a pull... as described in this manual.
